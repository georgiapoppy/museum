            <h2>Welcome to the World Museum's Asset Digitisation Solution.</h2>
            <p>From preserving and understanding history, fostering lifelong learning, or embracing cultural experiences; museums are crucial in ensuring history lives on forever. And as the state of the world is ever evolving, and so is technology; the digitisation of museum artefacts is more important than ever before.</p>
            <p>We were given the task to digitise over 25 million scientific specimens and cultural artefacts located in the World Museum. Digitising their collection not only allows further collaboration in scientific research, but connects cultural objects back to their communities. There are 8 specimen categories, 8 business requirements to meet, and 5 years to complete the digital database.</p>
            <p>Our solution covers the 8 business requirements, and topics 1, 3, and 4.</p>
            <p>Please use the menu bar at the top of the website to navigate through the pages and learn more about our proposed solution!</p>
