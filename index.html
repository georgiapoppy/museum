            <h2>Welcome to the World Museum's Asset Digitisation Solution.</h2>
            <h3>By Georgia, Kyan, Kemal, Rhett, Bailey and Jean-Pierre.</h3>
            <p>From preserving and understanding history, fostering lifelong learning, or embracing cultural experiences; museums are crucial in ensuring history lives on forever. And as the state of the world is ever evolving, and so is technology; the digitisation of museum artefacts is more important than ever before.</p>
            <p>We were given the task to digitise over 25 million scientific specimens and cultural artefacts located in the World Museum. Digitising their collection not only allows further collaboration in scientific research, but connects cultural objects back to their communities. There are 8 specimen categories, 8 business requirements to meet, and 5 years to complete the digital database.</p>
            <p>Our solution covers the 8 business requirements, and topics 1, 3, and 4.</p>
            <p>Throughout this website, we will discuss why our solution is the most beneficial, cost-effective and easiest to implement for the museum. Navigate to the <strong>Database</strong> page to learn about the chosen database software and online integration idea, the <strong>Imaging</strong> page to find out about the object digitalisation techniques, or the <strong>Tracking</strong> page where we will discuss how we plan to keep track of all the objects. We have also thoroughly planned out the timeline and budget constraints for the project, which you can read about on the <strong>Timeline</strong> page, as well as our extensive list of credible websites and papers we have referenced on the <strong>References</strong> page.</p>
            <p>Please use the menu bar at the top of the website to navigate through these pages and learn more about our proposed solution! Thank you so much for your consideration and reach out to us if you have any questions or if any of the website links are not accessible.</p>
