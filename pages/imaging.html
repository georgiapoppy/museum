        <h2>IMAGING</h2>
        <p>An important question is how do we digitally reconstruct each sample? For example, we might want a 3-dimensional model for a large dinosaur skull, or images of an ancient manuscript. Different object types often require different imaging techniques to be efficiently digitised and useful for researchers and virtual visitors.</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">3D SCAN</h2>
                <p>For small dry objects, liquid preserved objects and assemblages, a 3d scan will be ideal. Here, we map the object's surface using many vertices, which are connected with 2D shapes to form a mesh. There are scanners with extremely high frame-per-second rates and scanning accuracy, which is necessary to ensure that scanning is fast and is effective for small samples (Kivolya, N., 2020).</p>

                </div>
                <p>These scanners can also be used in areas with poor reception. For example, similar 3d scanners have been used to scan a monolith in the Peruvian jungle (McMillion, 2021).</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">MICRO-CT SCAN</h2>
                <p>World museum will also have frozen tissue samples of endangered or extinct species, so we need to use a scan which can illustrate the inner structure of the sample without destroying it. This motivates the use of micro-computed tomography, or Micro-CT. Here, an X-ray beam is sent through a sample, and the energy of the ray on the other side shows the 2D density of the smaple. Repeating this from multiple angles allows us to reconstruct a 3D map of the density of the sample (Duke University SMIF, 2017).</p>

                </div>
                <p>However, this scan also has important applications to other object types. Potential uses are skeletal imaging of non-frozen biological samples (Jerald Pinson, 2024) or reading sealed envelopes (Moutinho, 2021). Notably, this scanning technique could also be used for liquid-preserved objects. If the sample has high density relative to the preservant, then we can scan without removing the liquid (Duke University - SMIF, 2017). This could significantly reduce the preparation time for some samples, particularly if the preservant is toxic.</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING</h2>
                <p>Next, for paper-based objects, 3D imaging will not be the most accurate or computationally efficient method, so we will also use multispectral imaging. Here, we take high-resolution photographs in the visible light spectrum, but also in infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. This aims to counteract the fading, bleed-through or blurring of samples over time; for example, iron gall ink is more visible in infrared wavelengths, while ultraviolet light can reveal carbon underwriting (Duffy, C., 2013).</p>

                </div>
                <p>Also, a recent technique called “Multispectral Scheimpflug”  allows legible photographs to be extracted, even when the sample cannot be opened more than 30 degrees. This applies to 3% to 8% of all paper-based samples, and this method allows digitisation of otherwise inaccessible samples (Gregory Heyworth, 2022).</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">PHOTOGRAMMETRY</h2>
                <p>For large dry objects, we decided to use photogrammetry to digitise them as 3D models. Photogrammetry involves taking numerous photos or a few videos of an object from as many angles as possible. The photos or videos will then be processed by software to construct the 3D model of the object. The equipment involved for photogrammetry includes a video camera, a camera stabliser frame, and relevant software; however, to ensure the videos are high-quality, a photo booth and lighting equipment will be included as well.</p>
                <p>The objects will be moved, if possible, into photo booths set up to control the lighting and camera angles. If an object is too difficult to move, the booth will be set up around it instead. As photogrammetry requires recording the object from different angles, the camera stabliser is necessary to keep the video from moving too abruptly. Additionally, the object may have to be adjusted as well to allow the top and bottom of the object to be recorded. If an object is small enough, it can be placed on a turntable, which will reduce the effort of moving the camera around it and adjusting the lighting each time.</p>
                <p>To finally digitise the object, specialised software can interpret the videos frame by frame to construct a 3D model. This will require a strong computer with a good quality GPU as the rendering of a 3D model can take a very long time. As high-quality GPUs and computers are expensive, hiring a third-party to render the 3D model can save on costs of buying computers just for this project.</p>
                <p>Photogrammetry can also be used for pinned objects, as this allows us to digitise the sample without unpinning it. Here, we remove each pinned object from the tray and mount it in our workstation. Then, the tilting, rotation and photography of the sample is automated such that the images can be reconstructed into a high-accuracy 3D model. In bypassing the unpinning process, we virtually eliminate any damage to the sample, and we also significantly reduce the manual labour required, speeding up digitisation.</p>

                <h2 class="heading2">AUDIO VISUAL OBJECTS</h2>
                <p>To capture audio artifacts we need a controlled sound proof environment with specialized recording equipment. We begin this by setting up a room with soundproof walls and sealed entrances to stop external sound and echoes from affecting the recording. A microphone will be used to record the sound in 96 kilohertz resolution with dither applied analog to digital conversion to minimize error. Monitoring of the recording will be conducted using headphones to ensure accurate capture. For album cover documentation, a mirrorless camera and three point lighting setup to minimise glare will be set up. Photographs can be edited post production using professional software.</p>

                <p>For the environmental cost of our scan types, the structured light 3d scan and multispectral imaging have minimal carbon footprint [SOURCE]. Although the CT scan can have higher emission levels, for example due to cooling systems and data processing [https://qaelum.com/news/news/environmental-impact-of-ct-imaging], obtaining a thorough 3D model through the CT scan aims to reduce future emissions from travel of researchers to view the samples in-person. Finally, photogrammetry can also produce emissions in data processing, but this should be counteracted by the reduced transportation cost by taking simple high resolution images for audio-visual objects.</p>
